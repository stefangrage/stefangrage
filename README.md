## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Stefan

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m an associate lecturer at Copenhagen Shool of Design af Technology where I lecture about important stuff within Multimedia design...
- ğŸŒ± I like radical and surprising web designs. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking for new projects or collaborations - I just want to get my work done, so I can concentrate on things like tennis and rock-music.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about stupid questions - I'm good at answering stupid questions with stupid answers...
- âš¡ Fun fact: (silence)
